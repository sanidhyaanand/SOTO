/*  The seperation of our entire logic is done according to the MVC approach  
    This is all I can say */

    // Controller handles user input
    var controller = new Controller();

    // Display handles window resizing and rendering 
    var display = new Display();

    // Game handles the game logic
    var game = new Game();
